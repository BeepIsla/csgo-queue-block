# CSGO Queue Block

This was used to block players from queuing. **This has been patched and no longer works!**

If you got perma blocked, sorry. I never intended for it to cause problems, a bit of annoyance and that's it, but all fun things have to come to an end, especially when they get abused as more people learn about it.

Timeline:

- March 2021: First tested it, discovered a bit earlier but never tested it. Don't know the exact date anymore.
- 10th November 2021: Added to my private Discord bot for some people to use
- 15th February 2022: Sent an email to Valve
- 21st February 2022: Talked to Sparkles to create a video about it
- 24th February 2022: Valve fixed it
- 03rd March 2022: Sparkles releases video (https://youtu.be/GenRCacrkUM)
